I am currently an Assistant Professor at School of Computer Science, Peking University, dedicated to exploring the computational principles of the brain. I view the brain as an intricate computer with complex dynamics that offers profound insights for the development of brain-inspired and brain-like computing frameworks. 

In my previous role as a postdoctoral researcher with the Prof. Wolfgang Maass at Institute of Theoretical Computer Science, Graz University of Technology, I delved into brain-like computation and computational neuroscience. Before that, my doctoral research, conducted at School of Physics, the University of Sydney with Prof. Pulin Gong, focused on neurophysics, an interdisciplinary field bridging physics and neuroscience.

Research Interest
======
My primary research interest lies in unraveling the computational principles of the brain, with a specific focus on elucidating the link between the brain's structure, encompassing both its physiology and dynamics, and its computational functions. The intersection of computing, neuroscience and physics serves as my playground.

In addition, my research interest extends to showcasing the remarkable capabilities of the brain in brain-inspired and brain-like intelligent systems, specifically in areas like autonomous driving and robotics.

<!--
My approach involves modeling neural networks with physiological structures of the brain, followed by an analysis of the dynamic structures emerged from these physiological structures. This exploration extends to understanding the spatiotemporal correlation that arises from these dynamic structures, with the ultimate goal of unveiling the working mechanisms of the brain embedded in these correlated structures. To achieve this, I employ a multidisciplinary approach that intersects the fields of neuroscience, physics, computer science, and mathematics.
